##
## **Overview**

This is a Flask based app which predicts telecom customer will churn or not (whether the customer will continue with the existing telecom company or not).

##
## **Motivation**

Being from a Math and stats background ,I started to learn Machine Learning algorithms to get most out of it. I came to know mathematics behind all supervised models. Finally it is important to work on application (real world application) to actually make a difference.

##
## **Installation**

The Code is written in Python 3.7.10. If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after [cloning](https://www.howtogeek.com/451360/how-to-clone-a-github-repository/) the repository:

pip install -r requirements.txt
